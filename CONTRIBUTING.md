## üìù Code Style Guidelines

### JavaScript/React Native

- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow ESLint rules
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations

### Example:

```javascript
// Fetch all todos from the backend API
// This function uses async/await for cleaner asynchronous code
const fetchTodos = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get(API_URL);
    setTodos(response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    Alert.alert('Error', 'Failed to fetch todos');
  }
};
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Components**: PascalCase (e.g., `TodoItem`, `AddButton`)
- **Functions**: camelCase (e.g., `fetchTodos`, `addTodo`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `API_URL`, `MAX_ITEMS`)
- **Files**: camelCase or kebab-case (e.g., `todoItem.js`, `todo-item.js`)
