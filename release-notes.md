# 🎉 My Todo App v1.2.0 - Enhanced Configuration & Debugging

A modern React Native todo application with **built-in Settings UI** and **comprehensive debugging tools**. This release introduces dynamic server configuration and real-time event monitoring without requiring code changes.

## ✨ What's New (v1.2.0)

- **Settings Panel UI**: Toggle between local/remote servers directly in the app - no code changes needed!
- **Custom Remote Server URL**: Edit remote server URL for testing different production environments
- **Debug Panel**: Color-coded logging system with 7 event types (API/SOCKET/CONFIG/DATA/ERROR/FALLBACK/WARN)
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Watch API calls and Socket.IO events as they happen with timestamps
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Switch environments instantly with toggle buttons
- **Platform Detection**: Automatic Android emulator detection (10.0.2.2 vs localhost)

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Input Consistency**: Fixed input field not clearing when switching servers (added key prop for forced re-render)
- **Socket.IO Production**: Improved connection stability with polling transport for production environments
- **Faster Fallback**: Reduced fallback timeout from default to 300ms for better UX
- **Memory Leaks**: Proper socket cleanup with removeAllListeners() on configuration changes
